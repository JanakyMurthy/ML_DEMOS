This is a demo project to practice basic coding in context of ML. The objective of this demo project is to get
quickly familiar with some useful and popular libraries.

*Target libraries*: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
1. [Breast Cancer Detection using SVM](cancer_detection.py)

*Target libraries*: Tensorflow

2. [Fashion MNIST Classifier with neural network](fashion_mnist_classifier.py) - A fully connected feed forward neural network implemented with TensorFlow to classify Fashion MNIST dataset. Based on the official tutorial from the Tensorflow documentation. ([Results](FASHION_MNIST_RESULT_SAMPLE_OUTPUT.JPG))

3. [MNIST Classifier with neural network](mnist.py) - A Convoluted Neural Network implemented with TensorFlow to classify the MNIST dataset. ([Results](DL_models/MNIST_RESULT_SAMPLE_OUTPUT.JPG))

*Target libraries*: PyTorch

4. [A simple NN implementation in PyTorch](simple_nn_regression.py) - Generated random data points; Interestingly a neural network with 1-hidden layer is underfitting even for simple functions like y = x, y = x^2 etc... Will check on this behaviour in future.
