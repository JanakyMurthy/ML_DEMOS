This is a demo project to practice basic coding in context of ML. The objective of this demo project is to get
quickly familiar with some useful and popular libraries.

*Target libraries*: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
1. [Breast Cancer Detection using SVM](Classification/cancer_detection.py)

*Target libraries*: Tensorflow

2. [Fashion MNIST Classifier with neural network](DL_models/fashion_mnist.py) - A fully connected feed forward neural network implemented with TensorFlow to classify Fashion MNIST dataset. Based on the official tutorial from the Tensorflow documentation. ([Results](DL_models/FASHION_MNIST_RESULT_SAMPLES.JPG))

3. [MNIST Classifier with neural network](DL_models/mnist.py) - A Convoluted Neural Network implemented with TensorFlow to classify the MNIST dataset. ([Results](DL_models/MNIST_RESULT_SAMPLES.JPG))

*Target libraries*: PyTorch

4. Some regression problem implemented with a 1 layer neural network...
