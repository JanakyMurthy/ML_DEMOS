This is a demo project to practice basic coding in context of ML. The objective of this demo project is to get
quickly familiar with some useful and popular libraries.

*Target libraries*: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
1. [Breast Cancer Detection using SVM](Classification/cancer_detection.py)

*Target libraries*: Tensorflow, Keras
2. [Fashion MNIST Classifier with neural network](DL_MODELS/fashion_mnist.py) - A hello world tensorflow program. 

*Target libraries*: PyTorch
4. Computer Vision - YOLO Algorithm
